<span class="source-line-no">004</span><span id="line.4"> * A group of similar methods for getting hashes of points based on int coordinates in 2, 3, 4, or 6 dimensions and</span>
<span class="source-line-no">005</span><span id="line.5"> * an int for state; the code is similar to {@link HastyPointHash} but will be much faster on GWT. This</span>
<span class="source-line-no">006</span><span id="line.6"> * implementation has high enough quality to be useful as a source of random numbers based on positions, but would</span>
<span class="source-line-no">007</span><span id="line.7"> * likely not be a good option in a hash table (or at least not as good as the tailored implementation of</span>
<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line.8"> * {@link Coord#hashCode()}; it is still better than {@link java.util.Objects#hash(Object...)}). Even on a desktop</span>

<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line.10"> * owes credit to Pelle Evensen for finding the significant quality increase from using multiple bitwise rotations XORed</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line.11"> * together, and Martin Roberts for discovering the connection between higher dimensional ranks and the appropriate</span>

<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line.13"> * "harmonious numbers." The only case where this can return different results on GWT than on a desktop or mobile</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line.14"> * JVM is when the inputs are GWT-specific out-of-range JS Numbers appearing to be ints, and that's a problem with</span>

<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line.8"> * &lt;a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/229625477"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, specifically a CMR with a 64-bit state, that has</span>
<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line.9"> * its result multiplied by a constant. Its period is unknown, and it has multiple subcycles with different period</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line.10"> * lengths, but one is at the very least 2 to the 42, since the generator passes PractRand after generating that many</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line.11"> * 64-bit integers (it passes 32TB with no anomalies), and all states that can be produced using {@link #seed(int)} have</span>
<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line.12"> * a minimum period of 2 to the 20, or roughly one million. It also can pass TestU01's BigCrush suite in both forward</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line.13"> * and reversed bit order, though not for all seeds (as expected).</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line.14"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">015</span><span id="line.15"> * Notably, this generator's {@link #nextLong()} method is extremely small (as are all of the methods that use it as a</span>
<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line.16"> * basis), which may help with inlining decisions for HotSpot. Generating the next step just needs a bitwise rotation of</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line.17"> * the current state, multiplying the result by a 32-bit constant, and assigning that to state. Generating a long after</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line.18"> * that only needs a multiplication by another constant, which doesn't have the issues with reversed-bits testing that</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line.19"> * some other generators do when they multiply as their only output step (xorshift128 notably has patterns in its low</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line.20"> * bits, so multiplying by a constant doesn't help those bits, but the CMR generator here has no such low-bit problems).</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line.21"> * This means only three math instructions need to be performed to get a new random number (bitwise rotate left,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line.22"> * multiply, multiply), which is extremely low for a high-quality generator. While the CMR state change does not</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line.23"> * pipeline well, the ease of calculating a complete number seems to make up for it on desktop JVMs.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line.24"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line.25"> * The choice of constants for the multipliers and for the rotation needs to be carefully verified; earlier choices came</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line.26"> * close to failing PractRand at 8TB (and were worsening, so were likely to fail at 16TB), but this set of constants has</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line.27"> * higher quality in testing. Other constants did well in PractRand but had failures in TestU01 (even down to SmallCrush</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line.28"> * when reversed). For transparency, the constants used in this version:</span>

<span class="source-line-no">030</span><span id="line.30"> * &lt;li&gt;The state multiplier is 0xAC564B05L (or 2891336453L), which is one of the constants evaluated in Tables of Linear</span>

<span class="source-line-no">032</span><span id="line.32"> * with a modulus of 2 to the 32 and an odd addend (this doesn't have an addend, but it isn't an LCG either).&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">033</span><span id="line.33"> * &lt;li&gt;The post-processing multiplier is 0x818102004182A025L (or -9115001970698837979L), which is a probable prime with</span>
<span class="source-line-no">034</span><span id="line.34"> * a low Hamming weight (14 bits of 64 are set), in the hope it will perform well speed-wise. This number doesn't seem</span>
<span class="source-line-no">035</span><span id="line.35"> * as critical to the quality of the generator, and some other multipliers probably work just as well.&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">036</span><span id="line.36"> * &lt;li&gt;A left rotation constant of 29, which was chosen because it seems to allow the generator to pass certain</span>

<span class="source-line-no">040</span><span id="line.40"> * This is a RandomnessSource but not a StatefulRandomness because it needs to take care and avoid seeds that would put</span>

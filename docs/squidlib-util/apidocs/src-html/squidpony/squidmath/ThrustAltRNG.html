<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line.9"> * A random number generator that is extremely fast but can't return all possible results. ThrustAltRNG passes TestU01's</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line.10"> * BigCrush, which is a difficult statistical quality test. On &lt;a href="http://gjrand.sourceforge.net/"&gt;gjrand&lt;/a&gt;'s</span>

<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line.13"> * this passes all 32TB of generated numbers without finding any failures (and very rarely finding anomalies). Like</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line.14"> * {@link LightRNG}, this changes its state with a steady fixed increment, and does hash-like adjustments to the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">015</span><span id="line.15"> * current state to randomize it (the change is not a cipher because it is not reversible; this may be an advantage</span>
<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line.16"> * for some usage). The period on ThrustAltRNG is 2 to the 64. ThrustAltRNG is very strong on speed, outpacing the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line.17"> * default generator for {@link RNG}, {@link DiverRNG}, by a small margin, and most other RandomnessSources in</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line.18"> * SquidLib by a larger margin (it is slower than {@link MiniMover64RNG}, but this has a better period). Similarly to</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line.19"> * other hash-like PRNGs such as {@link LightRNG}, ThrustAltRNG has a {@link #determine(long)} method that takes a state</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line.20"> * as a long and returns a deterministic random number (each input has one output, though in this case the reverse isn't</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line.21"> * true and some outputs will be returned by multiple inputs). Like LightRNG, but unlike an LCG such as</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line.22"> * {@link java.util.Random}, changing the seed even slightly generally produces completely different results, which</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line.23"> * applies primarily to determine() but also the first number generated in a series of nextLong() calls. This generator</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line.24"> * is GWT-safe but will be much slower on GWT than generators designed for usage there, such as {@link GWTRNG} or</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line.25"> * {@link Lathe32RNG}.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line.26"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line.27"> * Because this generator can't produce all longs (it is not equidistributed), that alone is enough to discount its use</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line.28"> * in some (mainly scientific) scenarios, although it passes all major testing suites (TestU01's BigCrush, PractRand</span>
<span class="source-line-no">029</span><span id="line.29"> * over the full 32TB of tests, and gjrand to some degree, at least better than most). DiverRNG is the default</span>
<span class="source-line-no">030</span><span id="line.30"> * generator after ThrustAltRNG was used extensively for some time, since DiverRNG passes the same tests, is almost as</span>
<span class="source-line-no">031</span><span id="line.31"> * fast, and is known to produce all longs over the course of its period. One small change was required to pass a test</span>
<span class="source-line-no">032</span><span id="line.32"> * added in PractRand version 0.94, going from a shift of 22 to a shift of 23 at the end of the generation. Without this</span>
<span class="source-line-no">033</span><span id="line.33"> * change, ThrustAltRNG will eventually fail PractRand (failing "TMFn" tests, which check for patterns like those in a</span>
<span class="source-line-no">034</span><span id="line.34"> * linear congruential generator such as {@link java.util.Random}), but only after 16TB of data has been analyzed. Even</span>
<span class="source-line-no">035</span><span id="line.35"> * if using a version before the shift was changed on June 8, 2019, the quality is probably fine.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">036</span><span id="line.36"> * &lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="source-line-no">037</span><span id="line.37"> * There was a ThrustRNG in SquidLib, but it failed statistical tests badly in roughly a minute of testing, so even</span>
<span class="source-line-no">038</span><span id="line.38"> * though it was faster it probably wasn't a good idea to use it. ThrustAltRNG modifies ThrustRNG's algorithm very</span>
<span class="source-line-no">039</span><span id="line.39"> * heavily, and isn't especially similar, but the name stuck, I guess. The idea behind the name is that the generator is</span>
<span class="source-line-no">040</span><span id="line.40"> * acting like a thrust in fencing, pushing quickly but leaving a hole (not in the quality, but in the distribution).</span>
